# Text-Analytics
**Sentiment Analysis**


The goal of this report is to apply the principles covered in the Text Analytics module to a real
world problem: mainly sentiment analysis of Amazon Fine Food Reviews. Through this 
assignment, I hope to gain hands-on experience preprocessing text data, applying various text 
analytics algorithms, and visualizing and interpreting the results.  
The report is organized as follows: I begin by summarizing the problem statement, its significance, 
and the role of text analytics in addressing it. I then detail the data gathering process and the dataset 
used in the analysis. This is followed by a full description of the preparation methods used to clean 
and prepare raw text data for analysis. I then discuss the use of several text analytics approaches, 
such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, named entity identification, and text classification and 
clustering. The analytical results are then shown and summarized to provide significant findings 
and insights. Finally, I interpret the findings in light of the original problem statement and explain 
their consequences.
